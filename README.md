This project is a simple web application that allows users to store and retrieve their personal data using an API.
The project uses Django framework and Django REST framework to create a backend server that handles the API requests.
The project also uses SQLite database to store the user data.
The project defines two API endpoints: one for creating a new user and one for getting the user data by a key.
The project uses POST and GET methods to send and receive the data in JSON format.
